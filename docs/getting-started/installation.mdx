## Install FlashMCP

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install and manage FlashMCP.

If you plan to use FlashMCP in your project, you can add it as a dependency with:

```bash
uv add FlashMCP
```

Alternatively, you can install it directly with `pip` or `uv pip`:
<CodeGroup>
    ```bash uv
    uv pip install FlashMCP
    ```

    ```bash pip
    pip install FlashMCP
    ```
</CodeGroup>

## Verify Installation

To verify that FlashMCP is installed correctly, you can run the following command:

```bash
FlashMCP version
```

You should see output like the following:

```bash
$ FlashMCP version

FlashMCP version:   0.4.2.dev41+ga077727.d20250410
MCP version:                                1.6.0
Python version:                            3.12.2
Platform:            macOS-15.3.1-arm64-arm-64bit
FlashMCP root path:            ~/Developer/FlashMCP
```

## Installing for Development

If you plan to contribute to FlashMCP, you should begin by cloning the repository and using uv to install all dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jlowin/FlashMCP.git
cd FlashMCP
uv sync
```

This will install all dependencies, including ones for development, and create a virtual environment.

To run the tests, use pytest:

```bash
pytest
```
